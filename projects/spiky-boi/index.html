          This project combines the conceptual underpinnings of the Maison 치 Bordeaux and the Tankiawa House to create a new building for inhabitance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bordeaux House, Maison 치 Bordeaux, was designed by OMA for a man in a wheelchair and his family. Central to the home was a room that could be raised and lowered to any elevation within the house; it was the fundamental mobility mechanism that provided a seamless lived experience at each level, yet could exist independently at any position in its vertical range. Maison 치 Bordeaux was a building as machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Tankiawa House was designed by Kazuo Shinohara for Japanese poet Shuntaro Tanikawa as quiet complentative sancuary. The starkly bare house is built on a forest slope and its main space is the "earth room", where the natural ground is left exposed. Shinohara also described the house as a machine but for him it meant an array of "naked things" that somehow produce meaning. The house was also very mathematically precise.
        </p>
        <p>
          We created a house that brought elements of both houses together. The bordeaux x tankiawa house is designed as a solitary retreat for a wheelchair user. The building consists of three parts, a metal shell that sheathes the house, the bare interior made from perfect geometric volumes, and a central hemispherical room. The center of the building holds a large circular bowl that that acts as a portal for a wheelchair bound person, in which to travel from one side of the house to the other, the user enters and tips the bowl with their body weight. The building is a black-box machine. The human user enters the house through a small portal as the input, and is psychologically shaped by the architecture through their inhabitance. The only observable external indication of interior processes is by the lip of the bowl peeking out of the oculus as it rolls around. Like in Maison 치 Bordeaux, this central room has an infinite set of positions yet can exist in complete liminal isolation for medication. The physicality of the architectural space and the human bocy, like in the Tankiawa House is intimately experienced in using body weight to change the orientation of the central room.
